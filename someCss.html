		<h1>Level 1: Newbie</h1>
		<p><p1>Hey there! My name is John, and I am doing the CSS assignment for INFO 101. I don't really know what my paragraphs should contain so I'm just typing what is on my mind. 
		Hopefully this is okay. My favorite fast food place is Taco Bell. I like dogs, and enjoy seeing them around campus and the city on sunny days. 
		</p1></p>
		<p><p2>I wish I was going to Coachella next weekend. But unfortunately I will not be attending... I will probably be working instead. I wonder when the Bumbershoot lineup will be announced.
		 I hope it's good! Man, I am tired and have work at 6 AM tomorrow. But at least I'll be done by the afternoon. Well, I should probably wrap it up. 
		</p2></p>
